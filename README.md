A very warm welcome!

This is my final project based on a buisness of an interior designer!

This website uses Django, Javascript, HTML, SCSS, Stripe API and Font awesome icons along with bootstrap and google fonts.

The email address and password are enviornment variables.

The stripe secret and publishable key are also enviornment variables.

Please install all the requirements from requirements.txt

The website shows different part of home like living room, kitchens etc. and provide designing solutions as well as shows it's pricing for different designs.

It also provides user an option to book a visit from designers.

There is a login and registeration portal.

Users can register and login to their account.

There they will see their cart and can shop online from the website.

To give a realistic view of payment portal, stripe api is used!

Finally the user can log out.

The contact form sends mail to the designer's email address from where the designer can get in touch asap.

The website uses bootstrap, thus it is mobile responsive!
